This is just a small script that logs what Hacker News stories you see and which
ones you click on. It saves all of this information to localStorage and displays
it on the site, to show you what you've already seen / clicked on.

The idea is that this can be used to create a content-based filtering
recommender system. I want to create such a system, but for that I need enough
training data. :)
